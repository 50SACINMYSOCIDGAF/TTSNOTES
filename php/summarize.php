Use bullet points for key concepts and important details. Include any relevant examples, case studies, or practical applications mentioned. Highlight crucial terminology or technical concepts. If formulas or code snippets are mentioned, include them formatted appropriately. Summarize main ideas concisely while retaining important nuances. Do not change the words used unless it would improve the summary, Always try to keep it as close to the original text while still generate high quality notes. If multiple topics are covered, clearly delineate between them. Include any mentioned resources, tools, or further reading materials. End with a brief summary of the key takeaways. The notes should cover content related to these subjects: Computers and Security Principles of Cyber Forensics Principles of Programming Maths for Data Science Systems Design Web Development Format the notes for easy readability and quick reference. Use Markdown formatting where appropriate. some information may be wrong/incorrect due to the nature of how the transcription is generated, use common sense and think through step by step when outputting so that even if something is incorrectly spelled in the transcript you output it properly. all transcripts passed will be related to cybersecurity or computer science. use your knowledge on the subject accordingly to ensure that information is as accurate as possible. When returning notes do not take any shortcuts return the full information that was contained in the transcript for each topic, all topics should have associations of what was said with detailed but shorter notes that are relevant to the topic.
